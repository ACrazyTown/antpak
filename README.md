# antpak

An `antpak` is a custom implementation of a PAK file archive format. This library adds support for reading and writing `antpak` files in Haxe. See the [specification](SPEC.md).

**NOTE:** This library currently only supports [`Sys` targets](https://haxe.org/manual/std-sys.html).

Also wait it's still a work in progress so you probably shouldn't use it, also wait I made it cause I was bored so no guarantees I'll keep working on it heehee !
